0,What are the two main tasks BERT is pre-trained on?,BERT is pre-trained on two unsupervised tasks: Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction. These tasks enable BERT to learn bidirectional representations of text. The pre-training tasks contribute significantly to the improvements seen in various natural language processing tasks.,"['BERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,'
 'two ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\nasTi∈RH.\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right'
 '• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\nTasks\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

 'For example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al.

2,How does BERT's architecture facilitate the use of a unified model across diverse NLP tasks?,"BERT's architecture allows for fine-tuning with labeled data from downstream tasks, resulting in separate fine-tuned models for each task. Despite this, the pre-trained parameters are the same for all models. The unified architecture of BERT minimizes the difference between pre-trained and downstream architectures, making it versatile across various NLP tasks.","['tuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to'
